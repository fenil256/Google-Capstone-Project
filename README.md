# 1) Scenerios 
Google has already provided the detailed scernerios and waht i have to do as junior data anlayst here is the brief summary of scenerios 

"You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations."

# 2) Data Collecting 

According to the scenario and situations the question that keeps coming for the report of the project are 
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members
These three question are the question which needed the most attention and we have to find answer to solve the 
business decision. 

Data Resources

So for that we have been already provided the data resources which is to be used for the project.
We are using previous 12 months data for analyzation and for the business decision.
The data set was located in this site - Index of bucket "divvy-tripdata"
In that we have used the the data of January 2022 to December 2022 data to answer the question 

(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are 
appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. 
under this license.)

# 3) Excel 

We are using excel for the data cleaning. It is helpful for the cleaning and formatting of the data 
Cleaning , Formatting and Filtering

# 4) Python
Python program for  rechecking the the data set and confirming the values that everything is correct before visualizing 
There’s an separate python file for the codes and that checked  various things for  analyzation 

- [**File**](https://github.com/fenil256/Google-Capstone-Project/blob/main/Project.ipynb) -  Here's the Python file 

# 5) Visualization
- I have used the Microsoft Power BI tool for the data visualization if you want to check it out you can chek the visualization by clicking th elink below
